 <h2>Reflection</h2>
 <p>In the sprint I allow the user to choose whether they want to print or quit, if they choose to print, then they can choose
	 which menu to print. Before they choose which menu to print a "list" of menu options with numbers (e.g pasta, vegan, dessert) appears
	 and from there they can select the NUMBER of the menu they would like to print. All of this works fine, however, the one thing that 
	 doesnt work properly is the quit option. For some unknown reason, sometimes it work and the program stops, and other times the loop will
	 keep going. I am not sure why and am still trying to figure this out. In my next Sprint this will be fixed and I also plan to give the
	 user the option to order in Sprint 2, as well as validate. Before I a loop inside of my menu_loop, which I found out was uneccessary
	 and was actually confusing the program. Therefore, I got rid of this loop, I also decided to change options : "A" and "B", to "P"
	 (for print) and "Q" (for quit). After realising that I had lots of loops for no reason (e.g for i in range loop and True / False loop) I got 
	 rid of these unessessary loops and their indentation which finally allowed my quit button to work.

 <h1>Reflection</h1>
 <p>In this sprint I added the 'order' option. I feel like my ordering system is quite chaotic and
	 because there are quite a few functions and in some of these functions its hard to access certain
	things. In Sprint 3 I'm going to tidy things up. In this Sprint I
	encountered a few problems. Number 1: as you can see above when I made my confirmation function,
	I forgot to added 'return False' for an unrecognized entry, this caused the 'unrecognized entry' 
	to repeat. Luckily I realised my mistake and was able to fix it (as you can see in the last photo.
	Problem 2: there are many major validation issues in my program that cause the program to crash as
	you can see above. For that issue, the user entered an index number which was not in the list, this
	can be be fixed with validation based on the length of the list in Sprint 3. Other validation issues 
	I will fix with be based on capitalisation of string input as well as min and max values for the 
	amount someone can order.
</p>

<h1>Sprint Three</h1>
<h2>Sprint three brief</h2>
				<p>In this sprint I made a lot of progress, I made an edit order function, where the user can delete the 
					order by changing the amount to zero or they can reduce and increase the amount. I also made a Review 
					order function, they can review their total order. With validation, I made sure they couldn't review their
					order if they havent order anything. The system tells them "you havent ordered anything yet, please 
					order first". I also added a customer info function, here the user enters their name, address and phone number
					if they choose their order to be delivered. If they choose pick up, they enter their name, phone number and the 
					tells them how long it will take for their meal to be made. Each meal takes 20mins to make, therefore I multiply 
					20mins by the different type of dishes in their order list. I added validation here which prevents them from 
					reviewing their order if they haven't ordered anything. If the customer has aready entered their details 
					and they enter the customer details option again, then the system says "We already have your details, 
					would you like to re-enter your them (Y/N)". If they select Y, then the list clears and they have re-enter 
					their details and they can even change whether they want pick up or delivery. I also did a little bit of 
					tidying up, such as editing the format of my program (e.g lines etc.) </p>

<h2>Tests</h2>
<p>When I first started to try and make my pickup or delivery function I coded severly mess up the code. Here I was
	trying to personalise the system so that is says: "Aru, would you like pickup or delivery". The output didnt work 
	and there was a weird error here.
</p>
<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/SPRINT3/V3CustomerDetailsError.png" alt="">
<hr>
<br>
<p>This is what happened once I was finally able to make it work. Now the user was able to enter their name as well as 
	their phone number and address. If they chose the P option, they would only have to enter their name and phone number
</p>
 <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/SPRINT3/V3DeliveryIssue.png" alt="">
 <hr>
 <br>
 <p> due to my "get integer" function, the user cannot enter anything other than integers in the phone number area, this 
	 was a positive outcome 
</p>
 <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/SPRINT3/V3MustBeIntegerPhoneNumber.png" alt="">
 <hr>
 <br>
 <p> Another issue with my code was that the customer details function was not apart of the main menu. Instead the customer
	 details function was incorperated in the order option. This they had to enter their details each time they ordered, 
	 which means the customer list had their details twice or more. 
</p>
<br>
<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/SPRINT3/CUSTOMERANDORDERING.png" alt="">
<hr>
<br>
<p>
	You can see this in the example below, where the name "Paul" has been written twice in the list. 
	Below you can also see that I added a function which allows the user to review their order, 
	I didnt have any errors creating this function as it was basically the same as my print functions.
</p>
 <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/SPRINT3/NAMETWICE.png" alt="">
 <hr>
 <br>
 <p>here is the code for the issue above</p>
 <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/SPRINT3/V3UnsuccessfulCustomerDetailsCode.png" alt="">
 <hr>
 <br>
 <p>I fixed this issue by putting the customer details as an OPTION in the menu, therefore the user can choose when they enter
	 the customer details. I also added validation to fix the main issue of the name being entered twice into the list. Now, if 
	 the user tries to enter theor details again, they will be reminded that the system already has ther detials. After that,
	 the system asks them "do you want to enter you details again?", this means they can change the name, adress, phone number 
	 and even their decision on whether they want Pickup or delivery. 
 </p>
 <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/SPRINT3/V3RE-ENTERCUSTOMERDETAILS.png" alt="">

 <br>
 <p>Here is how I fixed the code:</p>
 <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/SPRINT3/V3SuccessfulCustomerDetailsCode.png" alt="">

 <br>
 <p>Another issue which occured was that the user wasnt able to return to the main menu
</p>
 <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/SPRINT3/V3AllDishesPrintingNotNeeded.png" alt="">
 <hr>
 <br>
 <p>This is the outcome of a test after I was able to fix it. This part of my system hasnt
	been coded very well and I still have to make improvements in the next sprint</p>
 <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/SPRINT3/V3ReturningToMainMenuSuccessful.png" alt="">
 <hr>
 <br>
 <p>When I first tried to make my edit order function, it didn't work and the system crashed when I tried 
	 remove an order
 </p>
 <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/SPRINT3/V3EditOrderRange_Issue.png" alt="">
 <hr>
 <br>
 <p>This is a succesful removing test after I fixed my code</p>
 <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/SPRINT3/EditOrderSuccess.png" alt="">
 <hr>
 <br>
 <p>With this test below: it successfully changes the amount when asked to, however, one big issue I noticed was that the price
	increases, no matter what amount I put in (unless I remove the dish). As you can see below, the price increases from $12
	to $24 even though I removed 2 rolls. I will try fix this in sprint 4.

 <br>
 <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/SPRINT3/WrongPrice.png" alt="">
 <br>
 <p>Here are some moments where the system crashed, these indicated the places where I particularly need validation. 
	 After various tests I have realised that one of my priorities is to put validation that prevents you from entering 
	 a number higher than a certain limit. E.g a limit on how MANY dishes you can order and obviously a limit on the dish 
	 index you choose to order from a list.

 <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/SPRINT3/InputIssueV3.png" alt="">
 <br>
 <p>Originally I only had only 1 basic printing function which wasnt very versatile for various types of lists.
	 I then created separate print functions which were catered to certain lists, e.g "print_list" prints 2 fields in a
	 very basic format, "print_with_price" prints the dish, a price rounded to 2 significant figures and an index number,
	"print_with_index" prints 1 field with an index and "print_order_with_indexes" prints the amount and the dish name with
	an index number. I am a little concerned that perhaps there is an simpler and cleaner way to code a print function which 
	works for all list, I will address this in Sprint 4. 
 </p>
 <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/SPRINT3/PrintingFunctions.png" alt="">
 <br>
 <p>Below is a successful review order test. One drawback with my review order function is that it does not give a grand
	 total and it does not ask the user to confirm their order, this will be a step I take in Sprint 4.
 </p>
 <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/SPRINT3/REVIEW_ORDER.png" alt="">
 <br>
 <p>Lastly, this was some successful validation that I coded. Here I stop the user from reviewing their order or editing 
	 their order if they havent ordered anything.

 <h1>Reflection</h1>
 <p>
	 Overall, in this sprint I added an edit order function (where the user can delete a dish or edit the amount), a review 
	 order function and a customer details function (where it asks for their name, whether they want pickup or delivery, their
	 address and their phone number. From all these tests, I've realised I have a lot to improve on and a lot more to do. 
	 In my next sprint I have to do lots of validation as well as fix current issues a tidy up my code. Specifically, I have 
	 to find a way to correctly update the prices when a user edit's their order. I realised that I was mutiplying the new 
	 amount (of the dish) by the old total price rather than the original price of the dish, this is something I will try 
	 fix in sprint 4. I also need to make a function to confirm the user's order, add a $3 DELIVERY CHARGE in the customer 
	 details function and find out how to calculate the grand total in the review order function. Theses were things I forgot 
	 to do in sprint 3. In terms of validation I need basic string validation, which is, converting string input into upper 
	 case. I also need integer limits for lists, phone number integer limits, address character requiremnets / limits as well 
	 as a limit on the amount of a dish that you can order. Most importantly I need to add validation which doesnt let the user 
	 quit the program until they have entered they're customer details. Another thing I need to figure out and improve on is 
	 the format of my program, I am planning to print the order in the customer details function. I might also make a "confirm
	customer details" fucntion. I also need to decide when to ask the user to confirm their order, I dont know whether I 
	should confirm their order once they press "quit" or if I should put it in another place e.g main menu?. I will confirm 
	the customer details in the customer details function. The system will ask, "are your detail correcct?", if they're 
	information is wrong they can re-edit it and cofirm again. Fianlly, I need to add more commenting and add doctyping.
	These are things I will add in future sprints.
