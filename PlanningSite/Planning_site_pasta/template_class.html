 <h2>Reflection</h2>
 <p>In the sprint I allow the user to choose whether they want to print or quit, if they choose to print, then they can choose
	 which menu to print. Before they choose which menu to print a "list" of menu options with numbers (e.g pasta, vegan, dessert) appears
	 and from there they can select the NUMBER of the menu they would like to print. All of this works fine, however, the one thing that 
	 doesnt work properly is the quit option. For some unknown reason, sometimes it work and the program stops, and other times the loop will
	 keep going. I am not sure why and am still trying to figure this out. In my next Sprint this will be fixed and I also plan to give the
	 user the option to order in Sprint 2, as well as validate. Before I a loop inside of my menu_loop, which I found out was uneccessary
	 and was actually confusing the program. Therefore, I got rid of this loop, I also decided to change options : "A" and "B", to "P"
	 (for print) and "Q" (for quit). After realising that I had lots of loops for no reason (e.g for i in range loop and True / False loop) I got 
	 rid of these unessessary loops and their indentation which finally allowed my quit button to work.

 <h1>Reflection</h1>
 <p>In this sprint I added the 'order' option. I feel like my ordering system is quite chaotic and
	 because there are quite a few functions and in some of these functions its hard to access certain
	things. In Sprint 3 I'm going to tidy things up. In this Sprint I
	encountered a few problems. Number 1: as you can see above when I made my confirmation function,
	I forgot to added 'return False' for an unrecognized entry, this caused the 'unrecognized entry' 
	to repeat. Luckily I realised my mistake and was able to fix it (as you can see in the last photo.
	Problem 2: there are many major validation issues in my program that cause the program to crash as
	you can see above. For that issue, the user entered an index number which was not in the list, this
	can be be fixed with validation based on the length of the list in Sprint 3. Other validation issues 
	I will fix with be based on capitalisation of string input as well as min and max values for the 
	amount someone can order.
</p>

<br>

<h1>Sprint Three</h1>
<h2>Sprint three brief</h2>
				<p>In this sprint I made a lot of progress, I made an edit order function, where the user can delete the 
					order by changing the amount to zero or they can reduce and increase the amount. I also made a Review 
					order function, they can review their total order. With validation, I made sure they couldn't review their
					order if they havent order anything. The system tells them "you havent ordered anything yet, please 
					order first". I also added a customer info function, here the user enters their name, address and phone number
					if they choose their order to be delivered. If they choose pick up, they enter their name, phone number and the 
					tells them how long it will take for their meal to be made. Each meal takes 20mins to make, therefore I multiply 
					20mins by the different type of dishes in their order list. I added validation here which prevents them from 
					reviewing their order if they haven't ordered anything. If the customer has aready entered their details 
					and they enter the customer details option again, then the system says "We already have your details, 
					would you like to re-enter your them (Y/N)". If they select Y, then the list clears and they have re-enter 
					their details and they can even change whether they want pick up or delivery. I also did a little bit of 
					tidying up, such as editing the format of my program (e.g lines etc.) </p>

<h2>Tests</h2>
<p>When I first started to try and make my pickup or delivery function I coded severly mess up the code. Here I was
	trying to personalise the system so that is says: "Aru, would you like pickup or delivery". The output didnt work 
	and there was a weird error here.
</p>
<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/SPRINT3/V3CustomerDetailsError.png" alt="">
<hr>
<br>
<p>This is what happened once I was finally able to make it work. Now the user was able to enter their name as well as 
	their phone number and address. If they chose the P option, they would only have to enter their name and phone number
</p>
 <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/SPRINT3/V3DeliveryIssue.png" alt="">
 <hr>
 <br>
 <p> due to my "get integer" function, the user cannot enter anything other than integers in the phone number area, this 
	 was a positive outcome 
</p>
 <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/SPRINT3/V3MustBeIntegerPhoneNumber.png" alt="">
 <hr>
 <br>
 <p> Another issue with my code was that the customer details function was not apart of the main menu. Instead the customer
	 details function was incorperated in the order option. This they had to enter their details each time they ordered, 
	 which means the customer list had their details twice or more. 
</p>
<br>
<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/SPRINT3/CUSTOMERANDORDERING.png" alt="">
<hr>
<br>
<p>
	You can see this in the example below, where the name "Paul" has been written twice in the list. 
	Below you can also see that I added a function which allows the user to review their order, 
	I didnt have any errors creating this function as it was basically the same as my print functions.
</p>
 <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/SPRINT3/NAMETWICE.png" alt="">

 <br>
 <p>here is the code for the issue above</p>
 <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/SPRINT3/V3UnsuccessfulCustomerDetailsCode.png" alt="">
 <hr>
 <br>
 <p>I fixed this issue by putting the customer details as an OPTION in the menu, therefore the user can choose when they enter
	 the customer details. I also added validation to fix the main issue of the name being entered twice into the list. Now, if 
	 the user tries to enter theor details again, they will be reminded that the system already has ther detials. After that,
	 the system asks them "do you want to enter you details again?", this means they can change the name, adress, phone number 
	 and even their decision on whether they want Pickup or delivery. 
 </p>
 <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/SPRINT3/V3RE-ENTERCUSTOMERDETAILS.png" alt="">

 <br>
 <p>Here is how I fixed the code:</p>

 <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/SPRINT3/V3AllDishesPrintingNotNeeded.png" alt="">

 <br>
 <p>This is the outcome of a test after I was able to fix it. This part of my system hasnt
	been coded very well and I still have to make improvements in the next sprint</p>
 <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/SPRINT3/V3ReturningToMainMenuSuccessful.png" alt="">

 <p>When I first tried to make my edit order function, it didn't work and the system crashed when I tried

 <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/SPRINT3/EditOrderSuccess.png" alt="">
 <hr>
 <br>
 <p>With this test below: it successfully changes the amount when asked to, however, one big issue I noticed was that the price
	increases, no matter what amount I put in (unless I remove the dish). As you can see below, the price increases from $12
	to $24 even though I removed 2 rolls. I will try fix this in sprint 4.

 <br>
 <p>Here are some moments where the system crashed, these indicated the places where I particularly need validation. 
	 After various tests I have realised that one of my priorities is to put validation that prevents you from entering 
	 a number higher than a certain limit. E.g a limit on how MANY dishes you can order and obviously a limit on the dish 
	 index you choose to order from a list.

 <br>
 <p>Originally I only had only 1 basic printing function which wasnt very versatile for various types of lists.
	 I then created separate print functions which were catered to certain lists, e.g "print_list" prints 2 fields in a
	 very basic format, "print_with_price" prints the dish, a price rounded to 2 significant figures and an index number,
	"print_with_index" prints 1 field with an index and "print_order_with_indexes" prints the amount and the dish name with
	an index number. I am a little concerned that perhaps there is an simpler and cleaner way to code a print function which 
	works for all list, I will address this in Sprint 4. 
 </p>
 <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/SPRINT3/PrintingFunctions.png" alt="">
 <br>
 <p>Below is a successful review order test. One drawback with my review order function is that it does not give a grand
	 total and it does not ask the user to confirm their order, this will be a step I take in Sprint 4.
 </p>
 <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/SPRINT3/REVIEW_ORDER.png" alt="">
 <br>
 <p>Lastly, this was some successful validation that I coded. Here I stop the user from reviewing their order or editing

 <h1>Reflection</h1>
 <p>
	 Overall, in this sprint I added an edit order function (where the user can delete a dish or edit the amount), a review 
	 order function and a customer details function (where it asks for their name, whether they want pickup or delivery, their
	 address and their phone number. From all these tests, I've realised I have a lot to improve on and a lot more to do. 
	 In my next sprint I have to do lots of validation as well as fix current issues a tidy up my code. Specifically, I have 
	 to find a way to correctly update the prices when a user edit's their order. I realised that I was mutiplying the new 
	 amount (of the dish) by the old total price rather than the original price of the dish, this is something I will try 
	 fix in sprint 4. I also need to make a function to confirm the user's order, add a $3 DELIVERY CHARGE in the customer 
	 details function and find out how to calculate the grand total in the review order function. In terms of validation I 
	 need basic string validation, which is, converting string input into upper case. I also need integer limits for lists, 
	 phone number integer limits, address character requiremnets / limits as well as a limit on the amount of a dish that you 
	 can order. Most importantly I need to add validation which doesnt let the user quit the program until they have entered 
	 they're customer details. Another thing I need to figure out and improve on is the format of my program, I am planning 
	 to print the order in the customer details function. I might also make a "confirm customer details" fucntion. I also 
	 need to decide when to ask the user to confirm their order, I dont know whether I should confirm their order once they 
	 press "quit" or if I should put it in another place e.g main menu?. I will confirm the customer details in the customer
	  details function. The system will ask, "are your detail correcct?", if they're information is wrong they can re-edit 
	  it and confirm again. Fianlly, I need to add more commenting and add doctyping. These are things I will add in future 
	  sprints.

<p>This was succesful pseudo code for calculating the delivery charge and grand total</p>
<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/SPRINT4/PAPERPLAN2.jpg" alt="">
<hr>
<br>
<h2>Tests</h2>
<p> One of the first issues with my code was that if the user edited their order, the price would always increase. I realised
	this was because I was multiplying the edited amount by the total price rather than the singular price. Below is the 
	incorrect code for calculating the price when editing the order, and the test. 
</p>
<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/SPRINT4/EditOrderWrongCode.png" alt="">
<br>
<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/SPRINT4/EditOrderPriceIssue.png" alt="">
<br>
<p>I fixed this by dividing the total price by the old amount, this calculated the singulr price. I then multiplied the 
	new amount by the singular price.</p>
<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/SPRINT4/EditOrderCorrectCode2.png" alt="">
<br>
<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/SPRINT4/EditOrderCorrectCode.png" alt="">
<br>
<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/SPRINT4/GrandTotalChangingWithEdit.png" alt="">
<br>
<p> At first I didn’t know how to calculate the grand total, I started off by making a price list and doing the sum of the 
	list. The first issue I realsied was my grand-total calculation were completely wrong. It turns out, this was because 
	there was an issue with the loop, causing certain prices to be added multiple times.</p>
 <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/SPRINT4/WrongPriceInList.png" alt="">
 <br>
 <p>This happened because each time the user reviewed their order, it re-calculated the grand total and appended it to the
	 price list. I fixed this by clearing the list each time the user wanted to review their order. This way, the price was 
	 re-calculated each time. This is a successful test after I was finally able to fix the grand total. The formatting of 
	 how the grand-total prints isnt good, I will fix this in my final sprint. I had to make a "grand_total_calc" function 
	 was separate from the review order fucntion as I also have to calculate / use this function in other areas of my code.  
 </p>
 <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/SPRINT4/CORRECTeditGrandTotalCode.png" alt="">
 <br>
 <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/SPRINT4/CorrectGrandTotal.png" alt="">
 <br>
 <p>the next issue I had was I didnt know how to incorperate the delivery charge into the function. At first, I tried to 
	 add a delivery charge to the price list in the customer details function. I realised this didnt work because everytime
	 the user reviews their order, the list is cleared, therefore the delivery charge is also cleared. Below are 
	 unsucessful tests where the system crahses or doesnt add on the delivery charge correclty.</p>

	 <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/SPRINT4/ReviewDeliveryChargeFail.png" alt="">
	 <br>
 <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/SPRINT4/DeliveryChargeWrong.png" alt="">
 <br>
 <p> I fixed this including the user's choice (Pick-up to Delivery) in the order list and then I used an "if" statement in 
	 the review order so that, if "D" / delivery is in the order list, then $3 is appened to the price list. However, then I 
	realised that this code doesnt take into account that the "pickup list" is shorter than the "delivery list" because in 
the delivery list there is the name, phone number, address, "D"; whereas in the pickup list there is the name, phone number, 
"P". This meant that c_list[x][3] is out of range for the pickup list </p>

 <br>
 <p> CONFIRM ORDER
 </p>
 <p> I made a confirm order function so that the user could confirm the dishes the order. I initially had a crash because 
	 I had the wrong arguments in my function, this was an easy fix. </p>
 <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/SPRINT4/ConfimOrderCrash.png" alt="">
 <br>
<p> Successful Code: this is the code for the user to confirm their order and below is the code for the user to 
	their customer details. For the confrim order function I ask the user if they confirm their order, if they say
	"Yes" it appends "Y" to the confirm order list and the confirm function terminates, if they say "No" it appends
	"N" to the confirm order list and asks them if they want to edit their order. If the user says no, the function 
	terminates. But, if they say yes, it call the edit_order function and they can edit their order. The same process 
	applies to the confirm customer function, however, instead of asking the user if they want to edit their details
	it just calls the "customer details function". This is because if there is already something in the list, 
	that function asks if you want to edit your customer details. One thing which I have to keep an eye on is that 
	I have called a function inside my function, which could be dangerous at times. Luckily my code is functional </p>
<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/SPRINT4/ConfirmOrderCode.png" alt="">
 <br>
 <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/SPRINT4/ConfirmCustomerCode.png" alt="">
 <br>

 <p>I then made a "finish ordering" function which prevents the user from leaving if they havent entered their details. As
	well as this, it calls the confirm order function and confirm customer function. At first I thought this function would
	work, however I encountered many problems, some of which I dont even know how to fix yet, I will try fix most of these 
	issues in my final sprint (sprint 5).
</p>
<br>
<p>The first issue I realised with my code was that the user could go to the "finishing order" function without ordering 
	anything or entering their customer details, I hadnt accounted for this in my initial validation. I also didnt account 
	for the fact that the user could've not ordered anything, and it's likely that the program could crash from this.
</p>
<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/SPRINT4/FinishingOrderWrongCode.png" alt="">
<br>
<p>I fixed this by adding this validation:
</p>
<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/SPRINT4/FinishingOrderValidation.png" alt="">
<br>
<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/SPRINT4/FinishingUpValidation.png" alt="">

<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/SPRINT4/FinishValidation2.png" alt="">
<br>
<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/SPRINT4/FinishingOrderSuccessTest1.png" alt="">
<br>

<p>The second issue was that I printed the grand total out of the loop of my grand total calculation function,
	this was so that the grand total doesnt't print multiple times, as the "for i in range" loop causes it to
	print multiple times. But putting it out of the loop has causes severe problems.
</p>
<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/SPRINT4/GrandTotalOutOfLoop.png" alt="">
 <br>
 <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/SPRINT4/FinishingOrderError.png" alt="">
 <br>

 <p>One of the biggest crashes I had was the when the finishing order function was malfunctioninf for some unknown reason. 
	 Here you can see that when the user confirms their customer or order details, the program starts doing weird things, 
	 especially when the user enters "No" to the questions, this is an issue I will fix in my final sprint. 
 </p>
 <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/SPRINT4/FinishOrderCrash.png" alt="">
 <br>
 <p>It was tricky to understand why my final issue occured</p>
 <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/SPRINT4/OutOfRangeCrash.png" alt="">
 <br>
 <p>I added validation to try and prevent the system from crashing again</p>
 <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/SPRINT4/FixingConfirmList.png" alt="">
 <br>
 <h2>Reflection</h2>
 <p>
As you can see from the large number of test, there were many functionality issues in functions (other than validation).
I realised the price in "editing order" wrong because I was multiplying the edited amount by the total price rather than 
the singular price. I also realised that when the user edits the order, the old price doesn’t remove from the price list.
I managed to fix this by clearing the price list each time the function is called, then i do the usual appending etc. I 
fixed this by dividing the total by the old amount, and multiplying by the new amount. Another issue is that I didn’t 
know how to store the prices and then calculate the grand total. I also realised that clearing the price_list, meant the 
delivery charge was also cleared. I fixed this by using an if statement to add a three dollar delivery charge in grand 
total function, after the list had been cleared. I also realised that if D is not in the list and P is instead, it crashes 
because the list is different lengths if they choose to pickup or delivery. I fixed this by writing : if “D” in c_list[i]
rather than a more specific statement : if "D" in c_list[i][3]. After this I added a confirm order and confirm customer
details function, I called these in my new "finishing up" function where it. This function was supposed to: asks them to 
confirm their order, confirm their details, clears all the list. However, I encountered some issues in this function. 
In the next sprint I will fix the issues I found in this sprint as well as adding solid validation.
